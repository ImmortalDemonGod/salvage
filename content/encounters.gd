# Encounters as DATA. Every beat after fight one needs a different anatomy,
# and "the enemy is the board" (SPEC 2.4) means an enemy IS a level: its
# limbs, which stations expose them, and what it does on its turn.
#
# The station-to-limb map lives here ONCE and is read by the sim and the
# presentation both, so the contract can never be two lists that agree
# (SPEC 4.2.3, the bug that made the gullet seal silent last project).
